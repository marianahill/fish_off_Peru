# Fish habitat timeseries analysis

This repository contains the scripts of our project.
We analysed two different datasets, a spatio-temportal dataset and a timeseries of fish landings.

- Script habitat_RF.ipynb has the modelling with two different random forests of the spatio-temporal dataset
- Script landings.ipynb has the modelling with RNN of the landings timeseries
- Script PeruOcean.RMd has a lot of graphics and spatial and temporal analysis of Peruvian marine animals
